# bash
My scripts.

I've written many bash scripts and I realized that I repeat myself :)
So I gather a few functions in one place: _bash_.sh.
Download this file and run it:

$ chmod +x _bash_.sh
$ ./_bash_.sh

You can use this functions in your own script, just add this line:

source /path/to/_bash_.sh
